I propose creating a remote-controlled car that uses 3 to 4 Arduinos and 2 to 3 motors to control the front wheels, simulating a two-wheel drive system, and potentially incorporating an axle motor mechanism to enable the wheels to turn. Each Arduino will be assigned external components based on the capacity of their workload, for instance, a motor
